# Exploratory Data Analysis of Synthetic Customer Transactions

This project completes the EDA tasks. The goal is to generate a synthetic dataset, run initial inspection, compute descriptive statistics, and create two required plots.

## Project Tasks
1. Generate a synthetic dataset of customer transactions.
2. Perform initial inspection of data types, missing values, and unique counts.
3. Produce descriptive statistics for numerical fields.
4. Create two plots:
   - Histogram of PurchaseAmount
   - Scatter plot of CustomerAge vs PurchaseAmount
5. Write a short summary of findings under 250 characters.

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/eda_synthetic_customer_transactions_data.py
